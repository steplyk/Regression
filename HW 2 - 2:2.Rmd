###3.7.1

####Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

The null hypotheses for newspaper (nearly zero sales per $1000), radio (189 sales per $1000), and tv (46 sales per $1000) aree not effecting sales, and are in turn equal to zero. The p-value for newspaper is large, and therefore isn't significant. The null hypothesis for newspaper is not rejected and newspaper doesn't help the sales. For radio and tv, the very small p-valures are very significant and we can reject the null hypotheses for these two.
