Load the data into R and perform exploratory data analysis. This includes (1) SKIM THROUGH VALUES IN SPREADSHEET FORM (use function View, case sensitive), (2) finding missing values, (3) finding any extreme values, (4) making some scatterplots (i.e.‚Äùplot(as.data.frame(matrixData))" works well), etc. *Summarize your findings in a reader friendly way with an Rmarkdown document. Make three plots with title, label, legend, caption. In Rmarkdown, you must create a pdf to allow captions. Use the header style that is given at the end of the syllabus.
